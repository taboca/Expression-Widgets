Expression Widgets - JetPack for Learning Challenge 
---
This project supports the JetPack for Learning Project (http://design-challenge.mozillalabs.com/jetpack-for-learning/) organized by Mozilla and supported by Mozilla, MacArthur Foundation, and other peers. 

Background: 

The original ideas to this project are based on Felipe Gomes and Marcio Galli motivation, said initial motivation. We were students from the same university in Sao Carlos Brazil and we since we are Mozilla contributors we started talking about means, being tools or systems, to support the development of open resources to support education. The original motivation was something like a note book where students could share their notes, for a given lecture of live session. 

Background for the JetPack for Learning Submission

Marcio Galli is coordinating the Expression Widgets submission and developed the following document as being the original proposal:

Project Abstract

An annotation system that uses JetPack infra-structure and introduces
a concept of expression widgets. The model leverages the browsing
experience and JetPacks are used to support learners to annotate using
Web language, given a live session - let's say a lecture given by a
professor. The model is suggested initially as a rich annotation and
collaboration framework where students can interact with a variety of
Web-based widgets. It explores various communication forms such as
text, canvas-based drawing, SVG, MathML, and also some interactive
scenarios where teams can build together. The annotated resources are
organized and kept using simple wiki pages with less rules to the
server and more focus on possibilities for team-centred conventions.

Project Status
===
* Documentation Wiki - General Parent Project - https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/Projects/JetpackForLearning
* 
* December 29th - Github project - the idea is to show the development milestones in a more open format. For this reason GitHub was selected and also because it serves well as a code repository.
