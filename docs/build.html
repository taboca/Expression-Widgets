<h1>Our Build System</h1>
<p>
Expression Widgets has an integrated build system. This build system is an experimental project and should be evaluated as a contribution to the platform in terms of ideas and needs/challenges. The Jetpack Prototype provides a mechanism to register one JavaScript file as being the developer application. It was found that this does not help much as the size of the application gets bigger.
</p>

<p>
So it was prefered to keep all the files as separated and join them, packaging them as a single file. The build system is no more than that except it has an option where some JS can be added at the end of everything as a means to enable/disable some integrated debugging options.
