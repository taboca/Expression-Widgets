<h2>Analysis of Jetpack-based Applications and Code Development</h2>

Most of the Jetpack-based examples are using markup that is brought as part of the single main application file. One interesting markup definition case shows the use of E4X-based notation as a means to insert a chunk of XML data into the JavaScript file. 

<pre>
var a = &lt;&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;This is my HTML&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/&gt;;
</pre>

<h2>Challenge associated with markup creation</h2>

Currently there is no way to define easy ways to reuse rules that can manage the generation of markup, or dispatch logic relative to a chain of events that can create rich user experience based on app's needs. 

<h2>Solution</h2>

<ul>
<li>jQuery helps</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other</h2>

Jetpacks are great ways to extend the browsing experience with a more lightweight and dynamic extension system. This state of creation creates new possibilities for the development of web applications. A new world of web-service connected extensions could be deployed. In this sense, an end-user should be able to mash rules that can produce user interface elements based on events associated with remote web services. Just like jQuery is a very nice, almost-template, way to query and modify things in the DOM, various template-based solutions could also be added to the infra-struture and serve as a way for Jetpack-based authors to create cool applications by just regulating the chain of events.  

End users could create Jetpacks by just mixing resources, web-remote resources, with structured User Interface interaction elements.
