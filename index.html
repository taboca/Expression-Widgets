      Expression Widgets is part of the <a href="http://design-challenge.mozillalabs.com/jetpack-for-learning/">JetPack for Learning</a>, an effort to support open education. The project proposes a system that leverages the web browsing experience and the JetPack infra-structure to support learners to collaborate and produce open-based educational resources. The model suggests a dynamic collaboration framework that lets students to create and share statements using Web-based content or resources captured from the web, for a given session topic. Expression widgets introduces a number of pre-developed widget modules to help define initial scenarios that can support collaborative annotation for sessions such as a lecture given by a professor. It explores various communication forms such as text, canvas-based drawing, SVG, MathML, and also some interactive scenarios where teams can build together. The annotated resources are organized and kept using simple wiki pages with less rules to the server and more focus on possibilities for team-centred conventions.

<h2>JetPack for Learning Experimentation</h2>

<p>Our goal is to test this system in a real educational environments and measure how the system can help open education. If you have suggestions or if you are willing to test this at your location please keep in contact - mgalli at mgalli dot com.</p>

<h3>Install the Prototype</h3>

<p>You can test the current version of the application using the URL available in this section. Make sure you have <a href="https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/">JetPack support</a> installed in your Firefox web brower. Once you have JetPack installed, use the following link to access the installation web page.

</ul>
</p>

<h3>Configure a Wiki and Screennames</h3>
<p>Once you have the Expression Widgets installed, you should make sure you have a wiki-based URL that you can write too. The current version of the application is compatible with the Mozilla wiki. We have setup some URLs for test purposes. These URLs were setup as part of this project and are not endorsed by Mozilla. Lecture URLs:

    <h2>Project Information and Development</h2>

 	<p>This project was born as part of the JetPack for Learning project. You can find additional information at the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/Projects/JetpackForLearning/Profiles/expressionWidjets">Mozilla Wiki</a> or the <a href="http://design-challenge.mozillalabs.com/jetpack-for-learning/">JetPack for Learning</a> design challenge project. </p>

<h3>Team Information</h3>

<p>Marcio Galli ( alumni at ICMC/USP ) and Thiago Campos ( student at ICMC/USP ). Thanks to Felipe Gomes ( alumni at ICMC/USP ) for original design and brainstorming prior to this challenge submission. ICMC/USP is the computer science department at Sao Carlos, part of University of Sao Paulo. This project is not affiliated to ICMC however the faculty department served as great inspiration for us to come up with with new ideas to help the develoment of more open-based educationi systems.
